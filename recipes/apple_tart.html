    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400 grams of shortcrust pastry.</li>
        <li>3/4 kg of reineta apples.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon powder.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of brown sugar.</li>
        <li>200 grams of pastry cream.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apricot jam (apricot).</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of water.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of lemon juice,</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the dough and line a 25 cm. high rim mold with it. The dough should not be too thin.</li>
        <li>Peel the apples, cut them into thin slices and mix them with the sugar and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Next, cover the base of the cake with the pastry cream and place the apples on top, making sure that the last layer forms a nice pattern. Bake in a preheated oven at medium temperature for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, cook the marmalade, together with the water and the lemon juice and let it boil for a few minutes, so that it mixes well.</li>
        <li>Finally, once the cake is baked, paint the entire surface of the apples with the diluted marmalade. Serve cold.</li>
